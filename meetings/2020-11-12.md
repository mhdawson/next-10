## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **next10-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* doc: add compatibility/interop technical value [#35323](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35323)
  * Proposed text: “Maximizing compatibility and interoperability with browsers and other
    JavaScript environments”

  * Other proposals:
    * Compatibility and interoperability with browsers and other JavaScript environments where it makes sense

  * agreed the following seemed good
    * Compatibility and interoperability with browsers and other JavaScript environments so that as
      much code as possible runs as is both in Node.js and in the other environments

  * Other notes
    * Add intro to the doc explaining that this should be revisited from time to time. This is a guide for making decisions but not a substitute for deliberation. Different subsystems may have different priorities. Tracking issue: [#34](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/34)


### nodejs/next-10
