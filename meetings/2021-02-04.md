### nodejs/next-10

* Key Technical Areas - Brainstorm to generate list [#39](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/39)
  * Darcy will open close of initial EasyRetro and well ask collaborators to
    add to that and then discuss next time.

* Needs/want of constituencies [#20](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/20)
  * First cut done, Michael will close
  * Will open new issue to track work to get broader input.

* Next 10 years for collaborators [#16](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/16)
  * our current contribution workflow, consensus seeking model, leadership model, etc
  * Barrier to start contributing is still high
    * custom commit message
    * requires time building,
    * takes time for PRs to be merged
  * Has been brought up a few times that lazy consensus might not be scaling 
    * may favor some (privileged)
    * may disfavor others (less time and/or ability to focus on contributing)
  * We did some brainstorming in this Easy Retro for this conversation:
